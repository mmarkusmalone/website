        Hi Joe,

        I hope this message finds you well. I came across your profile on LinkedIn and noticed your background in psychology. I am currently a rising senior at Duke—my major is computer science but I am also passionate about studying psychology, writing, and philosophy. This summer, I am working as an AI engineer while developing a project with a professor that uses VAD vectors from an emotional detection model to create a 3D emotional map of journal entries. I am interested in hearing how you integrate your academic background into your work as a software engineer manager. If you have any tips or time for a chat sometime, I would be grateful to learn from your experience. Let me know!

        Thank you,
        Maya Markus-Malone</p>
