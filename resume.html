            <p>I designed, developed, and deployed a Slack-integrated conversational agent using Python and LangGraph to centralize bug reports, improving support team efficiency and reducing duplicate QA tickets.</p>
            <p>I built automated pipelines to parse Slack messages, extract key identifiers, and query Intercom and Jira APIs for related tickets, enabling faster triage and resolution of customer issues. I implemented fallback mechanisms and error-handling strategies to manage API failures, malformed queries, and overflow scenarios, reducing downtime and improving reliability. I collaborated with support engineers to refine search parameters and workflows, ensuring results were accurate and actionable. I contributed to iterative improvements in bot functionality, balancing speed, precision, and user experience to better integrate with existing QA processes.</p>
            <p>I accelerated internal adoption of customizable AI agents by developing reusable, modular frameworks in Python and LangGraph, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment across teams.</p>
